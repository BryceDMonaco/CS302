This file contains the code for the \hyperlink{class_stack}{Stack} class used in P\+A03. This is a modified \hyperlink{class_stack}{Stack} class. It is based off of a \hyperlink{class_stack}{Stack} class that I had written for an assignment in C\+S202 during Spring 2016 (Project 8). It is missing a few functions which I deemed nonessential for this project.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This code was put into one file instead of a .h and .cpp because of issues with templating. The header section of this code is the only part taken from the 202 code, I set it up to be templated (originally it only worked with chars) and completely rewrote the implementation.
